        <p>
                I'm a second year Under-graduate student currently pursuing Computer Science and Engineering at
                NSIT, New Delhi, India. I'm new to the industry and keen to expand my skill set. I have a curiosity in
                the field of Web Development and Competitive Programming and using it to solve real world
                problems and am willing to take up opportunities to delve into it.
